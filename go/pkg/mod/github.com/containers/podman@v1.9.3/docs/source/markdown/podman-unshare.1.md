% podman-unshare(1)

## NAME
podman\-unshare - Run a command inside of a modified user namespace

## SYNOPSIS
**podman unshare** [*options*] [*--*] [*command*]

## DESCRIPTION
Launches a process (by default, *$SHELL*) in a new user namespace. The user
namespace is configured so that the invoking user's UID and primary GID appear
to be UID 0 and GID 0, respectively.  Any ranges which match that user and
group in `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` are also mapped in as themselves with the
help of the *newuidmap(1)* and *newgidmap(1)* helpers.

**podman unshare** is useful for troubleshooting unprivileged operations and for
manually clearing storage and other data related to images and containers.

It is also useful if you want to use the **podman mount** command.  If an unprivileged user wants to mount and work with a container, then they need to execute
**podman unshare**.  Executing **podman mount** fails for unprivileged users unless the user is running inside a **podman unshare** session.

The unshare session defines two environment variables:

- **CONTAINERS_GRAPHROOT**: the path to the persistent container's data.
- **CONTAINERS_RUNROOT**: the path to the volatile container's data.

## EXAMPLE

```
$ podman unshare id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),65534(nobody)

$ podman unshare cat /proc/self/uid_map /proc/self/gid_map
         0       1000          1
         1      10000      65536
         0       1000          1
         1      10000      65536
```
